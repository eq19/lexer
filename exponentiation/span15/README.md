# Chromodynamics (lexer)

This section serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the [gluon fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field) associated with the coloured quarks in [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) of [colours of the gluon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#Eight_gluon_colours). 

{% include list.liquid all=true %}

A gauge colour rotation is _[a spacetime-dependent SU(3)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(3))_ group element. They span the [Lie algebra](https://github.com/lkpetrich/Semisimple-Lie-Algebras) of the SU(3) group in the defining representation.

## Feynman diagram

```note
In this Feynman diagram, an electron (e‚àí) and a positron (e+) annihilate, producing a photon (Œ≥, represented by the blue sine wave) that becomes a quark‚Äìantiquark pair (quark q, antiquark qÃÑ), after which the antiquark radiates a gluon (g, represented by the green helix).
```

So basically  there is a basic transformation between ***[addition](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)*** of `3 + 4 = 7` in to their ***[multiplication](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/)*** of `3 x 4 = 12` while the 7 vs 12 will be treated as ***exponentiation***.

## Matrix Scheme

Quarks have three colors. Color is to the strong interaction as electric charge is to the electromagnetic interaction.

```

This exponentiation takes important roles since by the _[multiplication zones](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#parsering-structure)_ the MEC30 forms a matrix of  `8 x 8 = 64 = 8¬≤` where the power of 2 stands as exponent

```note
During the last few years of the 12th century, ***Fibonacci*** undertook a series of travels around the Mediterranean. At this time, the world‚Äôs most prominent mathematicians were Arabs, and he spent much time studying with them. His work, whose title translates as the Book of Calculation, was extremely influential in that ***it popularized the use of the Arabic numerals in Europe***, thereby revolutionizing arithmetic and allowing scientific experiment and discovery to progress more quickly. _([Famous Mathematicians](https://famous-mathematicians.org/leonardo-pisano-bigollo/))_

Since the first member is 30 then the form is initiated by a matrix of `5 x 6 = 30` which has to be transformed first to `6 x 6 = 36 = 6¬≤` prior to the above MEC30's square.

```note
Fermions and bosons‚Äîfermions have quantum spin = 1/2.
- The elementary fermions are leptons and quarks.
- There are three generations of leptons: electron, muon, and tau, with electric charge ‚àí1, and their neutrinos with no electric charge.
- There are three generations of quarks: (u, d); (c, s); and (t, b).

The (u, c, t) quarks have electric charge 2/3 while the (d, s, b) quarks have electric charge ‚àí1/3. _([IntechOpen](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/71535))_

Interactions in quantum chromodynamics are strong, so perturbation theory does not work. Therefore, Feynman diagrams used for quantum electrodynamics cannot be used.

![UF2](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/4d602e7a-ac0c-4c36-9f3f-741c40af5249)

Bosons have quantum spin = 1: photon, quantum of the electromagnetic field; gluon, quantum of the strong field; and W and Z, weak field quanta, which we do not need.

```note
An animation of [color confinement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement), a property of the strong interaction. If energy is supplied to the quarks as shown, the [gluon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) tube connecting [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) elongates until it reaches a point where it "snaps" and the energy added to the system results in the formation of a quark‚Äì[antiquark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiquark) pair. Thus single quarks are never seen in isolation. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction))_

## Interactions

The subclasses of partitions systemically develops characters similar to the distribution of prime numbers. 

```note
***Unlike the strong force, the residual strong force diminishes with distance, and does so rapidly***. The decrease is approximately as a negative exponential power of distance, though there is no simple expression known for this; see [Yukawa potential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_potential). The rapid decrease with distance of the attractive residual force and the less rapid decrease of the repulsive electromagnetic force acting between protons within a nucleus, causes the instability of larger atomic nuclei, such as all those with [atomic numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_number) larger than 82 (the element lead). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction#Between_hadrons))_

```note
The Gell-Mann matrices, developed by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann), are a set of eight [linearly independent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) 3√ó3 [traceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_trace) [Hermitian matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrices) used in the study of the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction) in [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics). They span the [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#SU(3)) group in the defining representation.
- These matrices are [traceless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceless), [Hermitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix), and obey the extra trace orthonormality relation (so they can generate [unitary matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix) group elements of [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(3)) through [exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential)[[1]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)). These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) for [SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2)) to SU(3), which formed the basis for Gell-Mann's [quark model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_model).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-2) Gell-Mann's generalization further [extends to general SU(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Pauli_matrices#Construction). For their connection to the [standard basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_system) of Lie algebras, see the [Weyl‚ÄìCartan basis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clebsch%E2%80%93Gordan_coefficients_for_SU(3)#Standard_basis).
- Since the eight matrices and the identity are a complete trace-orthogonal set spanning all 3√ó3 matrices, it is straightforward to find two Fierz completeness relations, (Li & Cheng, 4.134), analogous to that [satisfied by the Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices#Completeness_relation_2). Namely, using the dot to sum over the eight matrices and using Greek indices for their row/column indices
- A particular choice of matrices is called a [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation), because any element of SU(3) can be written in the form using the ***[Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation)***, where the eight 
 are real numbers and a sum over the index j is implied. Given one representation, an equivalent one may be obtained by an arbitrary unitary similarity transformation, since that leaves the commutator unchanged.
- The matrices can be realized as a representation of the [infinitesimal generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group) called [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(3)). The [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra) of this group (a real Lie algebra in fact) has dimension eight and therefore it has some set with eight [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) generators, which can be written as 
g_{i}, with i taking values from [1 to 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)

These matrices serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the ***[gluon fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field) associated with the coloured quarks of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) (cf. [colours of the gluon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon#Eight_gluon_colours))***. A gauge colour rotation is a spacetime-dependent SU(3) group element where summation over the eight indices (8) is implied. _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices))_

From the 50 we gonna split the 15 by _bilateral 9 sums_ resulting 2 times 15+9=24 which is 48. So the total of involved objects is ***50+48=98***.

```note
Consider the evidence: scattering experiments strongly suggest a meson to be composed of a quark anti-quark pair and a baryon to be composed of three quarks. The famous 3R experiment also suggests that whatever force binds the quarks together has 3 types of charge (called the 3 colors).
- Now, into the realm of theory: we are looking for an internal symmetry having a 3-dimensional representation which can give rise to a neutral combination of 3 particles (otherwise no color-neutral baryons).
-  The simplest such statement is that a linear combination of each type of charge (red + green + blue) must be neutral, and following William of Occam we believe that the simplest theory describing all the facts must be the correct one.
-  We now postulate that the particles carrying this force, called gluons, must occur in color anti-color units (i.e. nine of them).
- BUT, red + blue + green is neutral, which means that the linear combination red anti-red + blue anti-blue + green anti-green must be non-interacting, since otherwise the colorless baryons would be able to emit these gluons and interact with each other via the strong force‚Äîcontrary to the evidence.  So, there can only be ***EIGHT gluons***.

This is just Occam's razor again: a hypothetical particle that can't interact with anything, and therefore can't be detected, doesn't exist. The simplest theory describing the above is the SU(3) one with the gluons as the basis states of the Lie algebra.  That is, gluons transform in the adjoint representation of SU(3), which is 8-dimensional. _([Physics FAQ](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/gluons.html))_

In mathematics, orthonormality typically implies a norm which has a value of unity (1). Gell-Mann matrices, however, ***are normalized to a value of 2***.
- Thus, the [trace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trace_(linear_algebra)) of the pairwise product results in the ortho-normalization condition where delta is the [Kronecker delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kronecker_delta).
- This is so the embedded Pauli matrices corresponding to the three embedded subalgebras of SU(2) are conventionally normalized.
- In this three-dimensional matrix representation, the [Cartan subalgebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartan_subalgebra) is the set of linear combinations (with real coefficients) of the two matrices which commute with each other.

The SU(2) Casimirs of these subalgebras ***mutually commute***. However, any unitary similarity transformation of these subalgebras will yield SU(2) subalgebras. There is an uncountable number of such transformations. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices))_

# Prime Identity

We are going to assign prime identity as a ***standard model*** that attempts to stimulate a quantum field model called ***[eQuantum](https://github.com/eq19)*** for _[the four (4) known fundamental forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction)_.

This presentation was inspired by [theoretical works](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/13468466/OU1938-Y1.1.pdf) from _[Hideki Yukawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_Yukawa)_ who in 1935 had predicted the existence of _[mesons as the carrier particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meson)_ of strong nuclear force.

## Addition Zones

Here we would like to explain the way of said prime identity on getting the [arithmetic expression](https://youtu.be/S9oPqBeSsZA) of an ***individual unit identity*** such as a taxicab number below.

```note
It is a taxicab number, and is variously known as Ramanujan's number and the Ramanujan-Hardy number, after an anecdote of the British mathematician _[GH Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy)_ when he visited Indian mathematician _[Srinivasa Ramanujan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan)_ in hospital _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)))_.
```

[![Ramanujan-Hardy number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/103107461-173c2b00-4671-11eb-962c-da7e9eab022e.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number))

These three (3) number are [twin primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_prime). We called the pairs as _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_. Our scenario is mapping the distribution out of these pairs by taking the symmetrical behaviour of 36 as the smallest power (greater than 1) which is not a prime power.

```tip
The smallest square number expressible as the sum of **four (4) consecutive primes** in two ways (5 + 7 + 11 + 13 and 17 + 19) which are also **two (2) couples** of prime twins! _([Prime Curios!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1729_(number)](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=270)))_.
```

```scss
$True Prime Pairs:
 (5,7), (11,13), (17,19)
 
 layer|  i  |   f
 -----+-----+---------
      |  1  | 5
   1  +-----+
      |  2  | 7
 -----+-----+---  } 36 ¬ª 6¬Æ
      |  3  | 11
   2  +-----+

      |  5  | 17
   3  +-----+     } 36 ¬ª 6¬Æ
      |  6  | 19
 -----+-----+---------
```

Thus in short this is all about a method that we called as the ***[19 vs 18 Scenario](https://www.eq19.com/grammar/identition/#the-77-principles)*** of mapping [the quantum way](https://www.google.com/search?q=eQuantum) within a huge of [primes objects](https://github.com/eq19) (5 to 19) by [lexering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexer_generator) (11) the un[grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)ed feed (7) and [parsering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators) (13) across [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) (17).

```

The main background is that, as you may aware, the prime number theorem describes the [asymptotic distribution](https://youtu.be/j5s0h42GfvM) of prime numbers which is still a major problem in mathematic. 

## Multiplication Zones

Instead of a proved formula we came to a unique expression called ***zeta function***. This expression first appeared in a paper in 1737 entitled _Variae observationes circa series infinitas_. 

```tip
This expression states that the sum of the zeta function is equal to the product of the reciprocal of one minus the reciprocal of primes to the powers. But what has this got to do with the primes?  The answer is in the following product taken over the primes p (discovered by _[Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler)_):
```

![zeta function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219739322-ebdc1916-249a-49da-8ded-ce0fe1205550.png)

This issue is actually come from ***[Riemann hypothesis](https://youtu.be/zlm1aajH6gY)***, a conjecture about the distribution of complex zeros of the Riemann zeta function that is considered to be ***the most important*** of _[unsolved problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_mathematics)_ in pure mathematics.

```note
In addition to the trivial roots, there also exist ***complex roots*** for real t. We find that the he first ten (10) non-trivial roots of the Riemann zeta function is occured when the values of t below 50. A plot of the values of Œ∂(1/2 + it) for t ranging from ‚Äì50 to +50 is shown below. The roots occur each time ***the locus passes through the origin***. _([mathpages](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm))_.
```

[![trivial roots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219828222-615a2037-dbcd-4412-95bf-740bb32094de.png)](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath738/kmath738.htm)

Meanwhile obtaining the non complex numbers it is easier to look at a graph like the one below which shows Li(x) (blue), R(x) (black), œÄ(x) (red) and x/ln x (green); and then proclaim "R(x) is the best estimate of œÄ(x)." Indeed it is for that range, but as we mentioned above, Li(x)-œÄ(x) changes sign infinitely often, and near where it does, Li(x) would be the best value.

[![non complex numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219214486-e6412fb0-d190-45ae-990f-524532661444.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better)

And we can see in the same way that the function Li(x)-(1/2)Li(x1/2) is 'on the average' a better approximation than Li(x) to œÄ(x); but no importance can be attached to the latter terms in Riemann's formula even by repeated averaging.

## Exponentiation Zones

The problem is that the contributions from the non-trivial zeros at times swamps that of any but the main terms in these expansions.

```warning
A. E. Ingham says it this way: Considerable importance was attached formerly to a function suggested by Riemann as an approximation to œÄ(x)... This function represents œÄ(x) with astonishing accuracy for all values of x for which œÄ(x) has been calculated, but we now see that its superiority over Li(x) ***is illusory***... and for special values of x (as large as we please) the one approximation will deviate as widely as the other from the true value _([primes.utm.edu](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#better))_.
```

[![howmany primes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/87958552-dea18f80-cadb-11ea-9499-6c2ee580a5ca.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/howmany.html#pnt)

Moreover in it was verified numerically, in a rigorous way using interval arithmetic, that _[The Riemann hypothesis is true up to 3 ¬∑ 10^12](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09765.pdf)_. That is, all zeroes Œ≤+iŒ≥ of the Riemann zeta-function with 0<Œ≥‚â§3‚ãÖ1012 have Œ≤=1/2.

```danger
We have Œõ ‚â§ 0.2. The next entry is conditional on taking H a little higher than 10*13, which of course, is not achieved by Theorem 1. This would enable one to prove Œõ < 0.19. Given that our value of H falls between the entries in this table, it is possible that some extra decimals could be wrought out of the calculation. We have not pursued this _([arXiv:2004.09765](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09765))_.
```

[![functional equation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219715694-751fe538-378d-4f58-ae82-ac9e6823ad65.png)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.09765.pdf)

This Euler formula represents the distribution of a group of numbers that are positioned at regular intervals on a straight line to each other. Riemann later extended the definition of zeta(s) to all complex numbers (***except the simple pole at s=1 with residue one***). Euler's product still holds if the real part of s is greater than one. Riemann derived the functional equation of zeta function.

```danger
The Riemann zeta function has the trivial zeros at -2, -4, -6, ... (the poles of gamma(s/2)).  Using the Euler product (with the functional equation) it is easy to show that all the other zeros are in the critical strip of non-real complex numbers with 0 < Re(s) < 1, and that they are symmetric about the critical line Re(s)=1/2. The unproved Riemann hypothesis is that all of the nontrivial zeros are actually on the critical line _([primes.utm.edu](https://primes.utm.edu/notes/rh.html))_.
```

[![zeta function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219720444-e5ba30ac-e000-4c85-8678-186676b93d2b.png)](https://primes.utm.edu/notes/rh.html)

If both of the above statements are true then mathematically this Riemann Hypothesis is proven to be incorrect because it only applies to certain cases or limitations. So first of all the basis of the Riemann Hypothesis has to be considered.

```warning
The solution is not only to prove Re(z)= 1/2 but also to calculate ways for the imaginary part of the complex root of Œ∂(z)=0 and also to solve the functional equations. _([Riemann Zeta - pdf](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Riemann/Zeta/EZeta.pdf))_
```

On the other hand, the possibility of obtaining the function of the distribution of prime numbers shall go backwards since it needs significant studies to be traced.

Or may be [start again from the Euler Function](https://youtu.be/FCpRl0NzVu4).

## Identition Zones

While there are ***nine (9) possible*** combinations of color/anti-color pairs, due to symmetry considerations one of these combinations is eliminated. A gluon can effectively carry one of ***eight (8) possible*** color/anti-color combinations.

[![color charge and confinement](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/5c0f29a2-b3ac-4f93-90bf-1b5bd7bf9558)](https://fafnir.phyast.pitt.edu/particles/color.html)

We apply these generators to the rest of the space, and find that it breaks down into the SU(3)c representations of ***exactly three generations of quarks and leptons***.

[![The-64-dimensional-octonionic-chain-algebra-splits-into-two-sets-of-SU-3-generators](https://github.com/eq19/maps/assets/8466209/9fb5e061-0e82-4c0d-980d-528932ff1f3f)](https://github.com/eq19/maps/files/14387513/Standard_model_physics_from_an_algebra.pdf)

This 71 is a conformation that it has the same result as we have explained on the residual objects of 571 turn to a vektor of 71 while the rest of 500 turn to 200 objects of 3's identity and the last objects of 300 goes to the next cycles.

Nothing is going to be easly about the nature of prime numbers but they demonstrably congruent to something organized. Let's discuss starting with the _[addition zones](https://www.eq19.com/addition/)_.
